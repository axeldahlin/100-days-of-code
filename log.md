# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 43: July 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished the pomodoro timer I started yesterday. I also finished the last JavaScript30 video. The course was really awsome and I'm looking forward to learn more from Wes Bos in the future. Now its time to look for new things to build!
